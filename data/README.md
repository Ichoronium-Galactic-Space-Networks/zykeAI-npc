# Data

- `raw/` and `processed/` are gitignored; place source corpora in `raw/` and write outputs to `processed/`.
- Use `prepare_data.py` as a starting point for cleaning/splitting your text.
- `lib/wikipedia-downloader` contains a helper to fetch the 2020 Wikipedia dump and convert it to JSON shards.
